                  There’s no stopping now. Not with macroeconomic pressures
                  rising and climate commitments coming due for everything from
                  the energy transition to reducing emissions across the
                  end-to-end supply chain.

                  But what will it take to get ahead? Companies are jumping into
                  new opportunities: by mid-2023, one-third of global survey
                  respondents reported that their organizations were using
                  generative AI (gen AI) regularly in at least one business
                  function—and 40 percent said that gen AI advances were
                  prodding their organizations to increase overall AI
                  investment. At the same time, the industrial robotics industry
                  is projected to grow by more than 10 percent annually through
                  2030.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Whether that investment will pay off, however, is far from
                  clear. So far in this millennium, many of the technological
                  innovations leaders thought would accelerate productivity have
                  instead barely touched it. This is in sharp contrast to
                  20th-century breakthroughs such as the moving assembly line,
                  the shipping container, or just-in-time lean production
                  (Exhibit 1).

                  But a few companies, in both the manufacturing and service
                  sectors, are sailing past these obstacles. They’re achieving
                  major gains year after year not just in productivity but also
                  in metrics ranging from time-to-market to customer
                  satisfaction and employee engagement.

                  What these organizations have in common is a renewed and
                  expanded understanding of operational excellence. They aren’t
                  simply grafting technology onto existing operations. Instead,
                  they recognize that technology has changed fundamental
                  assumptions about what operations can (and should) achieve—in
                  much the same way that lean management and agile operating
                  models challenged how leaders thought about waste,
                  variability, and flexibility.

                  Crucially, the high performers routinely review and reimagine
                  how their business generates value, reexamining all five
                  elements of operational excellence (Exhibit 2):

                  Productivity and excellence depend on people
                </p>
                <p>
                  The payoff that matters is sustained, higher productivity to
                  fuel innovation and growth. That’s true for a company and even
                  more so across an entire economy. The McKinsey Global
                  Institute estimates that for the United States alone, the
                  difference between high and low productivity growth would
                  amount to nearly $50 trillion in wealth by 2030.

                  Technology has been a tempting productivity shortcut for
                  companies trying to find value from the latest innovations.
                  Survey data show widespread disappointment at the returns from
                  technology transformation, however, with most organizations
                  achieving less than one-third of the impact they expected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even when technology efforts achieve good initial results, the
                  success isn’t likely to last long. A 2022 survey on
                  implementing transformations found that only 12 percent of
                  transformation programs (across all types of transformation)
                  sustained their performance gains for more than three years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What’s missing from these change efforts, according to survey
                  findings from 2010, 2015, 2017, and 2021, is a focus on the
                  people side of productivity, performance, and technology. The
                  elements of operational excellence fill that gap,
                  acknowledging that solving a problem that appears to be
                  technological—whether reengineering a factory or optimizing a
                  generative AI prompt—usually requires a human touch.

                  While many are falling short, some are getting operations
                  right—and reaping disproportionate rewards, as illustrated by
                  examples from a multinational mining company, a North American
                  financial institution, and a natural-resources conglomerate.
                  All three started from positions of strength: high-performing
                  and innovative, with fewer problems concerning legacy systems
                  or brownfield sites than their peers. None was facing a
                  crisis, only a sense that if they could get more out of their
                  technology investments, they could pull even further ahead in
                  their respective industries.

                <p>
                  Sustained productivity and cost improvement. At the mining
                  company, the most tangible improvements were direct
                  productivity increases from tech optimization. Executives had
                  estimated that its top-performing, most technologically
                  advanced location could increase output only by about 7
                  percent, but within one year, output increased 25 percent
                  despite no additional capital investment by the company. Two
                  years later, output was nearly 40 percent higher than the
                  starting point, still with minimal investment but with
                  technology now yielding far greater impact. And at the
                  financial institution, costs fell by more than 11 percent
                  thanks in part to a 25 percent reduction in quality issues,
                  together with judicious deployment of technologies that helped
                  employees notice performance issues and make corrections in
                  real time.
